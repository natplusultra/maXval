maXval is a dynamic MERN stack application that provides crowdsourced product valuation for modern market research. The app enables individuals and companies of any size to quickly evaluate their products in a simple and approachable platform.
Using maXval, you can easily see how others view your product, receive valuable feedback to inform your marketing and pricing strategies, and discover a faster path to successful product launches.

### How It Works
* Start rating products immediately without signing up for an account, or log in to rate products and upload your own items for review. 
* Simply upload a product image and add a title, location, and description. The product will be saved to your account page and will also be displayed on the Rate page for others to review based on the following criteria: Quality, Appeal, and Value.
* On the User page, you can add more products for review or access your list of uploaded products.
* Clicking on a specific product on your User page will redirect you to that product's review data.
* Charts and graphs on the product's page will show the ratings distribution, total votes, and averages.

### Technologies Used
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Express, Node, MongoDB, Mongoose, Firebase, Axios, Materialize, Material-UI, Chart.js
